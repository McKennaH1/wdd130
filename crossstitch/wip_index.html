                    After a few weeks of working on the cross stitches of this project, I'm ready to move on
                    to the backstitching! One of the main selling points of this project was that I thought 
                    the backstitching looks absolutly beautiful. I was worried while doing the half stitches
                    in the bcakground becuase I thought it would be to light to notice. It was definently a 
                    trust the process moment for me!

                    This is page 10/20, which means that I'm officailly half way done with this project!
                    When I first started it I was very overwhelmed by just how many pages there were, it was 
                    my biggest project at the time. I can say that I've learned so much from this project and
                    I'm so excited to see it finished when I eventually get there!
