      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>One of my many hobbies that I take part in is cross stitching. And one thing I like to do is shared updates on my current projects. I was 
      thinking a website would be a good way to share updates. Also I could post some of my own patterns and tutorials on as well. A central area to 
      put everything cross stitch.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I currently upload any updates on Twitter and TikTok. So I beleive my main audience would be the followers that I have gathered so far on those,
        being other cross stitchers.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        <h2>Why do I cross stitch?</h2>
        <p>I first started cross stitching at a young age with a small project that I had lying aroung the house. Over the years I didn't have
          a lot of time to develop my hobby more when I was busy with other things such as school and other hobbies. During the pandemic in 2020 I discovered that I 
          had a lot of time and decided to work on a new project. Long story short, I probably spend more time then I should working on my lateset projects!
        </p>
        <h2>When will I be posting new updates?</h2>
        <p>While I try to work on my projects when I get free time, I don't have all the time in the world to work on them. But I plan on posting new updates
          on a certain day in the week. I plan on posting these updates on Wendesdays as a part of WIP Wednesdays over on TikTok.
        </p>
        <h2>What are my current WIPs?</h2>
        <p>These are my current WIPs:</p>
        <p>(I'll put in a list of my current wips after)</p>
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
      <p>(I'll be putting my own projects in, I just don't have access to them at the moment)</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Works in Progress updates</h3>
      <p>
        <h2>Epic Pokemon Cross Stitch Gen 4</h2>
        <p>This is my longest WIP that I have going on at the moment. The patten is 20 pages and I just finished page 10.
          So, I'm half way there! I've learned a lot from this pattern as it was my first very large project in my cross stitching career.
          I don't reccommend first timing cross-stitchers to choose this as the first pattern as I've been working on this off and on for over
          two years now.
        </p>
        <h2>Elegant Geisha</h2>
        <p>This is one of my newer WIP that I started in March of 2023, after finishing one of my more longer projects I needed a smaller one 
          to work on over the last few weeks of school before I moved home and this was the project I decided on!
        </p>

      <h3>Tutorials</h3>
      <p>
        <p>On this page I'll pretty much put tutorials and materials for people who want
          to get into cross stitching. For my wireframese I have a step by step with pictures 
          but I can also do a video if I figure out how to input videos into my website, or I can link youtube videos.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        What I wanted for my homepage was a quick intro, like why I cross stitch and my projects,
        just to show what exactly I'm doing at the moment so people can see right off the back on my website.

        This page is where I'll put my updates on my projects

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>         
        Here is where I'll put my tutorials, at the moment I plan on a step by step with pictures, but if I learn how 
        to put videos in my website I might do that instead.
