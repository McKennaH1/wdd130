    <h2>Hello Everyone!</h2>
    <p>My name is McKenna Harker! I am currently 24 years old and I live in Saratoga Springs, Utah.
        (Pink's my favorite color so I had to make it the background!)
    </p>
    
    <h2>Family</h2>
    <p>There are 6 of us in my family. My parents have been married for almost 26 years. I have a sister named Xandy who is 21 years old, another sister named Diana who is 14 years old, and a brother named Drew who is 11 years old. While being the oldest in my imdeiate family, I am also the oldest grandchild on both sides of the family! I also love experiencing the many different stories that come from not just video games, but movies and tv shows as well.</p>
   
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I've gotten into many hobbies over the years. A few that I'm currently into are cross-stitching and playing video games. I usually sit back and put on a good show or watch some YouTube videos and cross-stitch for hours! </p>
    
    <h2>Major</h2>
    <p>I've gone through so many differnt majors over the semesters here at BYU-I. I just couldn't pick something that I enjoyed or had a career that I wanted to go into. A few semesters ago I was thinking of going into geospatial computing and had to take an intro to databases class. I absolutley loved that class! I knew that it was the career I wanted to go into. So now I plan in majoring in Computer Information Technology with a certificate in databases!</p>
    
    <h1>I look forward to learning with you all this semester!</1>
